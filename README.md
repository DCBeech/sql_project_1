# Basic_EHCP

_I designed a simple relational database to showcase my technical skill in making a system for managing and storing information._

_My understanding of how to design a database for local authority children's servives would be considering he purpose of this database. The primary objective is to enable data-driven decisions that can improve educational outcomes for these individuals._

_All pieces of information are fictional and most personal data is loosely based on our current demographics in England._

_The database showcases a system for managing child details, funding information, and EHCP (Education, Health and Care Plan) records in a local authority's children's services department. It consists of three interconnected tables: "children_details" "funding_details" and "ehcp_details"._

_The ERD diagram shows seven main tables in the database: “students”, “parents”, “officers”, “schools”, “panel_provisions”, “lac_information”, “sen_needs”, and “band”._
